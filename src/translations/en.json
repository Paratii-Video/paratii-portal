Every new registered user on Paratii earns some tokens to experiment with. They show up on the top right of this page (click that icon!) or in our embedded player, when one is watching through other sites. Let's see what you can do with PTI?"

        "mainContent": "The basic operation here is staking. Whenever you upload a video, 5 of your tokens will be automatically \"attached to it\", as it enters the system. Think of it as a security deposit.",
        "subContent": "At any time, you will be able to retrieve your tokens back, which also delists the video from this web portal and related interfaces. On the other hand, those who leave tokens staked are continuously granted rewards, issued through inflation, and can also earn profits if the playlists their videos belong to are performing well (these two functions are not live yet). So uploading content and staking are forms of active participation in this economy."

Videos collectively rejected lose their stakes - forfeited PTI go to voters in the challenge (people who flagged or disapproved) and to all people actively staking tokens in the system, at the moment. That means that keeping a well curated record of videos - one that keeps attracting creators and spitting out harmful content - can be a profitable activity to the system's participants."
